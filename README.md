### Hi there 👋

My name is Julieta!

🌱 👩🏼‍💻  I am an environmental engineer and data scientist jr. 

I have just finished a data science bootcamp at Le Wagon, and I am starting some personal projects in order to acquire more experience into the data science field. 

I would love to work in environmental projects that involve data science 👯
